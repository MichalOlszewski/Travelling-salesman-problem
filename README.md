# Travelling-salesman-problem
> Program is designed to find the shortest possible route between cities.

## General-information
It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. 

## Algorithm
To get the best possible result, I decided to use a genetic algorithm. 
The algorithm resembles genetic evolution.
